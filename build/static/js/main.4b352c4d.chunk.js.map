I'm so excited, this was my first opportunity to attend a hackathon, so far I have done GiveCamp Memphis that is also an intensive weekend challenge to help non-profits, but not a hackathon. I have heard about how participating in one could be a great opportunity to improve, engage, and network, so I attended to see how it was and I liked the idea a lot. After listening for a while I said \"I have to do this\" (I love challenges), I wasn't really sure if the time frame would be something that I could meet due to having long workdays, but I was convinced that I needed to at least try.`,\n      `Soon after the meeting, members in my closest community started talking about it and I posted looking for partners to work in this and Will reached out. We meet via Zoom the night after the hackathon started so we already were 1 day behind, but we talked about goals and expectations for this challenge, and even knowing that we were in different time zones we were on the same page, and we said \"let's do this\" and started working right after the meeting.  \n            The hardest part for me was to balance my work, family activities, studies, and the project; sometimes it’s hard when you have more responsibilities and your family depending and counting on you but, that is when the commitment and goals come into play. Thankfully I managed to make it happen of course with my family’s support.`,\n      `Being this the first time for me managing a Github project and for Will to be in a development team was a great experience, even when we thought at times things were not right after some errors, but we got to figure things out. Every night we meet shared progress, set to-do’s, encouraged each other, and plan for the next day.`,\n      `This was for sure a stressful and absolutely fun week of challenges, fixing errors, lots of thinking, meetings, long nights, and pretty early days. At the beginning of the challenge, we said, \"Okay, let's try to make it on time, and if for some reason we can't, no problem we would still have a team project to finish and improve\", but two days later we saw what we had so far and we realized that we were making it happen and we went all-in with this project.`,\n      `The night after the deadline, we were almost ready and trying to fix something our game logic broke, and for some reason, those hours fixing that looked like forever until we finally got it working as we wanted to, and there we were deploying and submitting our project five days and a half after not knowing if we could make it on time but, we did it.`,\n      `I can personally say that I couldn’t be happier with this experience, it's been great to meet new people, to have the satisfaction of completing this project, and mostly to work within a team with someone that I didn’t know before.`,\n      `I'm already looking forward to future projects, challenges, meet new fellow developers, progress in my Front-end development career, and job to come.`,\n      `I hope to meet you in this journey!`,\n    ],\n  },\n  {\n    name: \"bootcamp-week-two\",\n    title: \"NuCamp Web and Mobile Dev Bootcamp week Two\",\n    date: \"05/03/2021\",\n    image: \"../images/studing.jpg\",\n    alt: \"\",\n    content: [\n      `Finishing my Bootcamp week 1 I could see the value of the camp and actually I liked it a lot. As soon as the live class was over I jumped in to start the week’s 2 tasks, and complete them all on that same day. \n            You know some people might think that I don’t have family, job, hobbies, or better things to do on a Saturday afternoon...But, the truth is that I actually have all of them together and that is what keeps me going.`,\n      `So going back to the topic, I finished all tasks with a good understanding of the components in bootstrap, learned about tabs, cards, forms, and more, completed the codopen challenges and quiz for the week. \n            The best part of week 2 is that we started the process of our personal or group projects. I say the best part because, in my journey, I had plenty of ideas but I was missing the actual process from beginning to end which is a big reason why I entered the Bootcamp so, this week I worked with my project idea from zero and had fun with it and after that I also had time to start doing a basic layout for the website while the majority of the time I had spent it reading, listening and practicing J.S.`,\n      `Our workshop for this week was fun, we had a review of this weeks material as well as this week’s material, as well as the introduction of some new concepts which our instructor did through a Kahoot game while explaining or clarifying any misconception something good as well, is that he is providing explanations as he is looking for and showing the documentation which reinforces the huge importance on referring to documentation often.`,\n      `After the review, we had to do our project pitch where we presented our idea to the class. This was a great exercise of how is how it is to actually do a pitch elevator as well as to receive and provide feedback to each other which personally made me realize that I wanted to consider some other ideas that I had in mind.`,\n      `At this point, I reach out to my instructor sharing the ideas I had in mind and he quickly pointed me to another of my ideas so I took that feedback. The end of our workshop was working with our final assignment for the week.`,\n      `At the end of each workshop we have to complete an assignment to be graded and move on. This challenge was a little longer than last week’s assignment I liked it because it got me thinking and looking for documentation. I was able to complete the challenge while we had group work time which I really enjoy because at that time we can support each other and figure things out`,\n      `So far so good here at nucamp Bootcamp, looking forward to a new week and diving into more complexity with javascript review and continuing shaping my project idea.\nThank you and I will be back soon with my week 3 into nucamp!.\nSee you later!\n`,\n    ],\n  },\n  {\n    name: \"is-a-coding-bootcamp-worthy\",\n    title: \"My Bootcamp Search Experience\",\n    date: \"04/20/2021\",\n    image: \"../images/computer-nature.jpg\",\n    alt: \"description alternativa\",\n    content: [\n      `Is a coding Bootcamp worthy? It is a common question within the web developer network. Some people say that they are worthy others say the opposite. A few months ago, I asked the same question to my network. I received feedback, made my choice, and realized that as a standard question, more aspiring developers might have the same so, I decided to post about my choice and journey, hoping that it can be helpful for someone out there.\n            I started my journey at the end of 2019. Still, it wasn’t until mid-2020 when I realized that I could do something with the skills I was acquiring, so I decided to work towards a career change after discovering my passion for web development. I started my journey as a self-taught using free courses and programs General Assembly Dash intro course, Freecodecamp, and youtube.`,\n      `As I was learning on my own, I started building websites, freelancing, learning, and progressing until I started looking for jobs, and soon I realized that I needed to add more skills to be competitive in the job search.\n            At this point, I have already heard about different boot camps and tons of success stories which lead me to apply to some, even getting accepted only to find out soon about the high cost and how time demanding they are. So that idea wasn’t an option anymore.`,\n      `So, I continued on my own but still felt the process could be better and faster. Then my husband showed me an ad about Nucamp, which appeared to be an affordable option, so I started checking Nucamp, researching, and asking about it in my network.`,\n      `I’m so grateful I received reviews from my network about this camp because they provided me with their own experience and different points of view, too many to mention but, I certainly can tell you a summary of what caught my attention:`,\n      `1. You get what you put in`,\n      `2. You will have a mix of self-learning and instruction`,\n      `3. Your instructors will guide you and help if needed`,\n      `4. Group experience`,\n      `5. Accountability`,\n      `6. Price and time flexibility`,\n      `Not everyone needs the structure, and not everyone can learn on their own, mostly when life is complicated with responsibilities, job, family, etc. So, that feedback given by network members was enough to get my conclusions: `,\n      `- I know I’m an extremely hardworking person, and if I could get what I put in, that will be in my favor.`,\n      `- I know my life is busy and if I could continue learning at my own pace but at the same time having an instructor guiding me and available just in case if I need assistance with anything, then it would be good for me.`,\n      `- I can work on my own but, still, I enjoy having teammates to study, work on projects, and share knowledge and experiences.`,\n      `- I have always enjoyed having accountability partners whenever I start a challenge; coding, fitness, and wellness challenges are my favorites. I genuinely like to have accountability from friends and network.`,\n      `- I will get the perfect combination of time flexibility to accommodate my learning around my full-time teaching job, three children, husband, extra activities while still having an affordable price was what I was needing.`,\n      `Based on the above, I decided to give Nucamp a try and go in with all I can provide, so; I joined the Full Stack Web and Mobile Development program.

So, I leave that alone in the past.`,\n      `To resume, after 2 years of teaching in the U.S. I was looking for ways to do something on the side and my brother told me \"HEY! do this to see if you like it\". It was an easy, simple, and engaging free tutorial from General Assembly. I can tell that from minute one of solving little challenges in the tutorial/course I ABSOLUTELY LOVED IT!`,\n      `From that day I couldn't stop, I finished and eager to learn more, after doing some research, I found FreeCodeCamp and decided to start with it, and again I loved it and moved along with the course and loved it. The problem came while I finished the first course of web development. I thought great I know this, now what? and nothing seemed to answer that question.`,\n      `Later on I continued questioning the same, now what can I do with this. Then a good friend needed a website and I said you know what I know how to do it, I can do yours. After researching we got her the hosting provider and domain. Now, one more time NOW WHAT? I didn't learn how to deploy, how to use a text editor, or even worse, the hosting provider installed WordPress... What???? all this time learning HTML & CSS and what is this???? So, nowadays I can say that impostor syndrome came, visited, and stayed with me for a while. I froze and couldn't move forward at all. `,\n      `I was ashamed and frustrated for not being able to help my friend at the moment. So, after a few months, this same friend sent me another free course given by a local college in Memphis, TN. there were two courses, one web development from 0 to deploy and I was like OHHHH this is what I was missing, and the other one was WordPress... Ding ding, I absolutely need this. Everything started to make way more sense.`,\n      `I recovered that feeling of excitement and that was the best thing that could happen. I loved it and reinforce things learned previously, it was a simple HTML & CSS course. But, how powerful when it showed how to deploy a site, MIND-BLOWING! `,\n      `Then, I wanted to complement my knowledge and learned WordPress so I could help my friend. I complete that course as well and great. Now, the question again... What's next? \n       After a while tumbling between web design, WordPress, and Web Development... Something happened, I discovered something absolutely NEW to me. I found podcasts talking about people who were self-taught web developers and got extreme career changes from different fields without a degree. `,\n      `I recovered that feeling of excitement and that was the best thing that could happen. I loved it and reinforce things learned previously, it was a simple HTML & CSS course. But, how powerful when it showed how to deploy a site, MIND-BLOWING! `,\n      `What? Really? It was hard to believe but the more I looked for the more people I found and got me thinking, analyzing things, setting new goals and challenges, by the way until this point I was on my own with no support or accountability from anyone else in the same journey that I was getting into so that was the missing part (if you haven’t joined communities please DO IT now). \n       Then, once I was starting to take it more seriously and having the hope given by others, my sister who is overseas started to ask me hey, how is this going I need to change my career and explore if this is for me. So I shared the podcasts I was listening to as well as FreeCodeCamp and started having that accountability partner that I was also missing. `,\n      `That alone changed everything!!!! Now I had someone virtually starting the same journey, following my steps, and learning from me. That made me realize that I actually knew more than I thought and helped me move forward quickly! `,\n      `Takeaways if your starting or considering getting into web development:`,\n\n      `1. START LEARNING: It doesn't matter what platform or resource but start learning NOW!`,\n      `2. START BUILDING: as you learn, start creating and building things even little things.`,\n      `3. JOIN COMMUNITIES: find a community and start following, learning, asking, and contributing.`,\n      `4. ACCOUNTABILITY: find accountability partners/community. A great place to start is 100daysofcode.`,\n      `5. TEACH OTHERS: learning together is great, but teaching is POWERFUL. You will reinforce concepts and realize how much you are learning if you teach. Nobody to teach? Use youtube!`,\n      `6. MENTORS: find mentors that guide you, answer questions, teach you even through videos that you really get it and feel related to (soon I will post my most influential developers).`,\n    ],\n
